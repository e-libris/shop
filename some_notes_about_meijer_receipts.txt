After the MIEJER SAVINGS and TOTAL SAVINGS sections, the receipt is always divided into the following sections
	SALE			begins the receipt proper	
	GENERAL MERCHANDISE 	section (if any)
	DRUGSTORE 		(if any)
	GROCERY			begins the food receipt, which continues until line TOTAL


-A purchase item always begins with a code and is always concluded with a purchase price.  

-A purchase line may span 1-3 lines.

-The conclusion of a logical item is based on the location of a decimal in column 40.  If
 an item will continue on the next line there will be whitespace after column 35.

-A '*' at the start of a code indicates that an item is on sale.

-Items sold by weight (most produce) contain weight purchased and price/unit weight information following an items purchase price.

-Items with "mPerks", "=>", and "Coupon" indicate price reductions in the items they proceed.  They appear only AFTER the conclusion of a logical item, that is, after a purchase price line.
